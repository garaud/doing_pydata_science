Doing Data Science in Python
############################

**Python** code samples and solutions based on examples and exercises in `Doing
Data Science`_ by `Rachel Schutt <http://columbiadatascience.com/>`_ and `Cathy
O'Neil <http://mathbabe.org/>`_

These code samples and solutions are splitted into different `IPython Notebooks
<http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`_.

Clone this repo and launch ``ipython notebook`` at the root directory of this
project. You can also launch the Bash script ``launch.sh`` which carries out the
same command with some specific ipython options.

You can alse use the NBViewer_ to read a notebook.

Data samples can be downloaded at the official *Doing Data Science* Github
project at https://github.com/oreillymedia/doing_data_science

For some exercises, I provide a Python script which downloads needed files.
